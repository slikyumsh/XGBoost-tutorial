# Dask + XGBoost Example

This project demonstrates how to use **Dask** for scalable, distributed machine learning with **XGBoost** on a local machine.

## üöÄ What This Project Does

- Sets up a local Dask cluster
- Generates synthetic classification data using `dask-ml`
- Trains a distributed XGBoost model on that data using Dask
- Monitors computation with the Dask dashboard
  

## ‚ùì What is Dask?
Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytics that scales from a single laptop to a large cluster. It provides advanced parallelism for analytics, enabling performance at scale for tools you already use:  

Familiar API: Dask mirrors the APIs of NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, so it's easy to switch from single-machine to distributed computing.  

Flexible and Scalable: Use it on your local machine, in the cloud, or on HPC systems.  

Efficient Scheduling: Dask schedules work dynamically and efficiently across multiple cores or workers.  

Interactive Dashboard: Real-time diagnostics and performance tracking via a built-in web UI (localhost:8787).    

Use Dask when your data is too big to fit in memory, or when you want to speed up computations using multiple cores or machines ‚Äî all while writing Python code that looks and feels familiar.



## üì¶ Requirements

Install the necessary dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install xgboost dask[complete] dask-ml
```

## üß† How to Run

Make sure your main Python file uses the correct multiprocessing idiom (required on Windows):

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## üìâ Monitoring

After the Dask cluster starts, you can open the dashboard in your browser:

```
http://localhost:8787
```

This gives you live insights into:

- Worker memory usage
- Task progress and scheduling
- CPU and I/O activity
- Execution time

## üß™ Example Output

```
[0.8732, 0.6541, 0.9214, ...]  # First few predictions
```
